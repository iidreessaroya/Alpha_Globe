Before applying for a visa, all exchange visitor applicants are required to be accepted and approved by an authorized program sponsor. When accepted, the applicant will receive from the educational institution or program sponsors the necessary approval documentation to be submitted when applying for a visa.</p>\n<p>The exchange visitor program's J visa is designed to promote the interchange of persons, knowledge, and skills in the fields of education, arts, and sciences. Participants include students at all academic levels; trainees obtaining on-the-job training with firms, institutions, and agencies; teachers of primary, secondary, and specialized schools; professors coming to teach or do research at institutions of higher learning; research scholars; professional trainees in the medical and allied fields; and international visitors coming for the purpose of travel, observation, consultation, research, training, sharing, or demonstrating specialized knowledge or skills, or participating in organized people-to-people programs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Dependents\">Dependents</h4>\n<p>Spouses or unmarried children under the age of 21 who wish to accompany or join the principal visa holder of a J-1 visa to the United States for the duration of his or her stay must have J-2 visas.

The B-2 visa is for travel that is recreational in nature, including tourism, visits with friends or relatives, medical treatment and activities of a fraternal, social or service nature.

You must overcome this legal presumption by showing:</p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li>That the purpose of your trip to the United States is for a temporary visit, such as business, pleasure, or medical treatment</li>\n<li>That you plan to remain in the United States for a specific, limited period of time</li>\n<li>Evidence of funds to cover your expenses while in the United States</li>\n<li>That you have a residence outside the United States, as well as other binding social or economic ties, that will ensure your return abroad at the end of your visit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/domestic-employee.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Personal or domestic employees</a> and crew members working aboard vessels within the Outer Continental Shelf may qualify for B-1 visas under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>Some foreign nationals may be ineligible for visas according to The Immigration and Nationality Act.

If you wish to engage in academic studies in the United States at an approved school, such as an accredited U.S. college or university, private secondary school, or approved English language program then you need an F-1 visa. You will also need an F-1 visa if your course of study is more than 18 hours a week.</p>\n<h5>M-1 Visa</h5>\n<p>If you plan engage in non-academic or vocational study or training at a U.S. institution then you need an M-1 visa.</p>\n<p>More information about each of these visas and opportunities for studying in the United States can be found at the Education USA <a href=\"https://educationusa.state.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"U.S.PublicSchools\">U.S. Public Schools</h4>\n<p>U.S. law does not permit foreign students to attend public elementary school (kindergarten to 8th grade) or a publicly funded adult education program. Hence, F-1 visas cannot be issued for study at such schools.</p>\n<p>An F-1 visa can be issued for attendance at a public secondary school (grades 9 to 12), but the student is limited to a maximum of 12 months at the school. The school must also indicate on the Form I-20 that the student has paid the unsubsidized cost of the education and the amount submitted by the student for that purpose.</p>\n<p>For more information about F-1 legal requirements, visit the Department of State <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa/foreign-students-in-public-schools.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Holders of A, E, F-2, G, H-4, J-2, L-2, M-2 or other derivative nonimmigrant visas may enroll in public elementary and secondary schools.</p>\n<h5>Student Assistance, Finding a U.S. School</h5>\n<p>Students who hope to enroll in a U.S. educational institution are encouraged to contact and visit <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html</a> and <a href=\"https://usefpakistan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.usefpakistan.org</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"ApplicationItems\">Application Items</h4>\n<p>To apply for an F or M visa, you must submit the following:</p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li>A Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application (DS-160) Form.

OPT is separate from a student's academic work, and time for OPT will not normally be reflected during the student's academic program or in the completed study date. Students applying for an F visa to do OPT may present an I-20 with an original end of study date that may have passed. However, these I-20s must be annotated by the designated school official to reflect approval of an OPT program that extends beyond the end of the regular period of study. In addition, the student must have proof that USCIS has approved their practical training program or that an application is pending, either in the form of an approved Employment Authorization Card or a Form I-797 indicating that s/he has a pending application for an OPT program.</p>\n<h5>Validity of Student Visas After a Break in Studies</h5>\n<p>Students who are away from classes for more than five months can expect to apply for and receive a new F-1 or M-1 student visa to return to school following travel abroad, as explained below.</p>\n<h5>Students within the United States</h5>\n<p>A student (F-1 or M-1) may lose that status if they do not resume studies within five months of the date of transferring schools or programs, under immigration law. If a student loses status, unless USCIS reinstates the student's status, the student's F or M visa would also be invalid for future travel returning to the United States. For more information see the USCIS website, and instructions for Application for Extend/Change of Nonimmigrant Status Form I-539 to request reinstatement of status.</p>\n<h5>Students - Returning to the United States from Travel Abroad</h5>\n<p>Students who leave the United States for a break in studies of five months or more may lose their F-1 or M-1 status unless their activities overseas are related to their course of study. In advance of travel, students may want to check with their designated school official, if there is a question about whether their activity is related to their course of study.</p>\n<p>When the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immigration inspector at port of entry is presented a previously used, unexpired F-1 or M-1 visa by a returning student who has been outside the United States and out of student status for more than five months, a CBP immigration inspector may find the student inadmissible for not possessing a valid nonimmigrant visa. CBP may also cancel the visa after granting the student permission to withdraw the application for admission. Therefore, it is prudent for students to apply for new visas at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad prior to traveling to the United States to return to their studies, after an absence of more than five months that is not related to their course of study.</p></div>", "employment_visa": "<div id=\"main-content\" class=\"editable\"><h2>Work Visa</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tochead\">On this page:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li><a href=\"#Overview\">Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#VisaDescriptionsandQualifications\">Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#WhentoApply\">When to Apply</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ApplicationItems\">Application Items</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#HowtoApply\">How to Apply</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SupportingDocuments\">Supporting Documents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Dependents\">Dependents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#MoreInformation\">More Information</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"pk-gen-faq.asp#qlistwork\">FAQ</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h4>\n<p>If you want to work in the U.S. temporarily as a nonimmigrant, under U.S. immigration law, you need a specific visa based on the type of work you will be doing. Most temporary worker categories require that your prospective employer or agent file a petition, which must be approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the United States before you can apply for a work visa.</p>\n<p>All applicants for H, L, O, P and Q visas must have a petition approved on their behalf by USCIS. The petition, <a href=\"https://uscis.gov/i-129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form I-129</a>, must be approved before you can apply for a work visa at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. When your petition is approved, your employer or agent will receive a Notice of Action, Form I-797, which serves as your petition's approval notification. The consular officer will verify your petition approval through the Department of State's Petition Information Management Service (PIMS) during your interview.</p>\n<p class=\"cms-float-left\" style=\"text-align: left;\">You must bring your I-129 petition receipt number to your interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in order to verify your petition's approval. Please note that approval of a petition does not guarantee issuance of a visa if you are found to be ineligible for a visa under U.S. immigration law.</p>\n<h4 id=\"VisaDescriptionsandQualifications\">Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</h4>\n<h5>H-1B (specialty occupation)</h5>\n<p>An H-1B visa is required if you are coming to the United States to perform services in a pre-arranged professional job.

An H-2A nonimmigrant classification applies to you if you seek to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature in the United States on a temporary basis. A U.S. employer (or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer) must file a Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf.</p>\n<h5>H-2B visa (skilled and unskilled workers)</h5>\n<p>This visa is required if you are coming to the United States to perform a job which is temporary or seasonal in nature and for which there is a shortage of U.S. workers. Your employer is required to obtain a Department of Labor certification confirming that there are no qualified U.S. workers eligible for the type of employment on which your petition is based.</p>\n<h5>H-3 (trainee)</h5>\n<p>An H-3 visa is required if you are coming to the United States to receive training from an employer in any field of endeavor, other than graduate education or training, for a period of up to two years.

To qualify for an L-1 visa, you must be at the managerial or executive level, or have specialized knowledge and be destined to a position within the U.S. company at either of these levels, although not necessarily in the same position as held previously. In addition, you must have been employed outside the United States with the international company continuously for one year within the three years preceding your application for admission into the United States. You may only apply for an L-1 visa after your U.S. company or affiliate has received an approved petition from USCIS, either on a \"blanket\" or individual basis.</p>\n<h5>L-2 (dependents)</h5>\n<p>If you are the principal holder of a valid L visa, your spouse or unmarried children (under age 21) may receive this derivative visa.

Before applying for a visa, all student visa applicants are required to be accepted and approved by their school or program. Once accepted, educational institutions will provide each applicant the necessary approval documentation to be submitted when applying for a student visa.</p>\n<h4 id=\"VisaDescriptionsandQualifications\">Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</h4>\n<h5>F-1 Visa</h5>\n<p>This is the most common type of student visa. If you wish to engage in academic studies in the United States at an approved school, such as an accredited U.S. college or university, private secondary school, or approved English language program then you need an F-1 visa. You will also need an F-1 visa if your course of study is more than 18 hours a week.</p>\n<h5>M-1 Visa</h5>\n<p>If you plan engage in non-academic or vocational study or training at a U.S. institution then you need an M-1 visa.</p>\n<p>More information about each of these visas and opportunities for studying in the United States can be found at the Education USA <a href=\"https://educationusa.state.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"U.S.PublicSchools\">U.S. Public Schools</h4>\n<p>U.S. law does not permit foreign students to attend public elementary school (kindergarten to 8th grade) or a publicly funded adult education program. Hence, F-1 visas cannot be issued for study at such schools.</p>\n<p>An F-1 visa can be issued for attendance at a public secondary school (grades 9 to 12), but the student is limited to a maximum of 12 months at the school. The school must also indicate on the Form I-20 that the student has paid the unsubsidized cost of the education and the amount submitted by the student for that purpose.</p>\n<p>For more information about F-1 legal requirements, visit the Department of State <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa/foreign-students-in-public-schools.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Holders of A, E, F-2, G, H-4, J-2, L-2, M-2 or other derivative nonimmigrant visas may enroll in public elementary and secondary schools.</p>\n<h5>Student Assistance, Finding a U.S. School</h5>\n<p>Students who hope to enroll in a U.S. educational institution are encouraged to contact and visit <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html</a> and <a href=\"https://usefpakistan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.usefpakistan.org</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"ApplicationItems\">Application Items</h4>\n<p>To apply for an F or M visa, you must submit the following:</p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li>A Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application (DS-160) Form.

Useful documents include school transcripts (original copies are preferred) with grades, public examination certificates (A-levels, etc.), standardized test scores (SAT, TOEFL, etc.), and diplomas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Dependents\">Dependents</h4>\n<p>Spouses and/or unmarried children under the age of 21 who wish to accompany or join the principal visa holder in the United States for the duration of his or her stay require derivative F or M visas. There is no derivative visa for the parents of F or M holders.</p>\n<p>Family members who do not intend to reside in the United States with the principal visa holder, but wish to visit for vacations only, may be eligible to apply for visitor (B-2) visas.</p>\n<p>Spouses and dependents may not work in the United States on a derivative F or M visa. If your spouse/child seeks employment, the spouse must obtain the appropriate work visa.</p>\n<p>Supporting Documents for Dependents</p>\n<p>Applicants with dependents must also provide:</p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li>Proof of the student's relationship to his or her spouse and/or child (e.g., marriage and birth certificates)</li>\n<li>It is preferred that families apply for their visas at the same time, but if the spouse and/or child must apply separately at a later time, they should bring a copy of the student visa holder's passport and visa, along with all other required documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"OtherInformation\">Other Information</h4>\n<h5>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</h5>\n<p>F-1 visa holders may be eligible for up to 12 months of optional practical training following completion of all course requirements for graduation (not including thesis or equivalent), or after completion of all requirements. OPT is separate from a student's academic work, and time for OPT will not normally be reflected during the student's academic program or in the completed study date. Students applying for an F visa to do OPT may present an I-20 with an original end of study date that may have passed. However, these I-20s must be annotated by the designated school official to reflect approval of an OPT program that extends beyond the end of the regular period of study. In addition, the student must have proof that USCIS has approved their practical training program or that an application is pending, either in the form of an approved Employment Authorization Card or a Form I-797 indicating that s/he has a pending application for an OPT program.</p>\n<h5>Validity of Student Visas After a Break in Studies</h5>\n<p>Students who are away from classes for more than five months can expect to apply for and receive a new F-1 or M-1 student visa to return to school following travel abroad, as explained below.</p>\n<h5>Students within the United States</h5>\n<p>A student (F-1 or M-1) may lose that status if they do not resume studies within five months of the date of transferring schools or programs, under immigration law. If a student loses status, unless USCIS reinstates the student's status, the student's F or M visa would also be invalid for future travel returning to the United States. For more information see the USCIS website, and instructions for Application for Extend/Change of Nonimmigrant Status Form I-539 to request reinstatement of status.</p>\n<h5>Students - Returning to the United States from Travel Abroad</h5>\n<p>Students who leave the United States for a break in studies of five months or more may lose their F-1 or M-1 status unless their activities overseas are related to their course of study. In advance of travel, students may want to check with their designated school official, if there is a question about whether their activity is related to their course of study.</p>\n<p>When the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immigration inspector at port of entry is presented a previously used, unexpired F-1 or M-1 visa by a returning student who has been outside the United States and out of student status for more than five months, a CBP immigration inspector may find the student inadmissible for not possessing a valid nonimmigrant visa. CBP may also cancel the visa after granting the student permission to withdraw the application for admission. Therefore, it is prudent for students to apply for new visas at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad prior to traveling to the United States to return to their studies, after an absence of more than five months that is not related to their course of study.</p></div>", "employment_visa": "<div id=\"main-content\" class=\"editable\"><h2>Work Visa</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tochead\">On this page:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"blue_bullets\">\n<li><a href=\"#Overview\">Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#VisaDescriptionsandQualifications\">Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#WhentoApply\">When to Apply</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ApplicationItems\">Application Items</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#HowtoApply\">How to Apply</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#SupportingDocuments\">Supporting Documents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Dependents\">Dependents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#MoreInformation\">More Information</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"pk-gen-faq.asp#qlistwork\">FAQ</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h4>\n<p>If you want to work in the U.S. temporarily as a nonimmigrant, under U.S. immigration law, you need a specific visa based on the type of work you will be doing. Most temporary worker categories require that your prospective employer or agent file a petition, which must be approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the United States before you can apply for a work visa.</p>\n<p>All applicants for H, L, O, P and Q visas must have a petition approved on their behalf by USCIS. The petition, <a href=\"https://uscis.gov/i-129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form I-129</a>, must be approved before you can apply for a work visa at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. When your petition is approved, your employer or agent will receive a Notice of Action, Form I-797, which serves as your petition's approval notification. The consular officer will verify your petition approval through the Department of State's Petition Information Management Service (PIMS) during your interview.</p>\n<p class=\"cms-float-left\" style=\"text-align: left;\">You must bring your I-129 petition receipt number to your interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in order to verify your petition's approval.

An H-2A nonimmigrant classification applies to you if you seek to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature in the United States on a temporary basis. A U.S. employer (or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer) must file a Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf.</p>\n<h5>H-2B visa (skilled and unskilled workers)</h5>\n<p>This visa is required if you are coming to the United States to perform a job which is temporary or seasonal in nature and for which there is a shortage of U.S. workers. Your employer is required to obtain a Department of Labor certification confirming that there are no qualified U.S. workers eligible for the type of employment on which your petition is based.</p>\n<h5>H-3 (trainee)</h5>\n<p>An H-3 visa is required if you are coming to the United States to receive training from an employer in any field of endeavor, other than graduate education or training, for a period of up to two years.

The international company may be either a U.S. or foreign organization. To qualify for an L-1 visa, you must be at the managerial or executive level, or have specialized knowledge and be destined to a position within the U.S. company at either of these levels, although not necessarily in the same position as held previously. In addition, you must have been employed outside the United States with the international company continuously for one year within the three years preceding your application for admission into the United States.
