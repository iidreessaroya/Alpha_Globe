That means:</p><ul><li>You will visit other countries but will be spending more days in Germany, than in any other</li><li>You will spend equal days in every country you visit, but you will enter the Schengen through Germany</li></ul><p>If none of the above statements apply to you, despite that you plan to visit Germany, among other countries, you may have to apply at the embassy of another Schengen member state.</p><h3>When to apply for a Tourist/Visitor Visa to Germany</h3><p>The earliest you can file your Schengen visa application is at most six months before your intended trip towards Germany. Whereas, the latest you can do so, is two weeks prior to your trip to Germany.</p><p>However, you are highly recommended to apply for a tourist visa at least 3 weeks before your travel date in order to avoid any processing delays.</p><h3>Visa fees\u00a0for a Tourist/Visitor Visa</h3><p>You will need to pay a visa fee in order for your application to be processed. The <a href=\"https://www.germany-visa.org/visa-fees/\">cost of a Schengen visa</a> as of 2020 is \u20ac80. However, there are <a href=\"https://www.germany-visa.org/visa-fees/\">categories that are exempt from paying the visa fee or have to pay a reduced fee</a>. Make sure you check if you belong to any of them before you pay the fee.</p><p>Please note the visa fees will not be reimbursed in case of visa rejection and the price is subject to change at any time.</p><h3>Visa Processing Time</h3><p>The processing of short-stay visas to Germany takes around ten days to be processed. However, at times when the embassy is processing a lot of visa applications, tourism visas may take a bit longer, since <a href=\"https://www.germany-visa.org/business-visa/\">business visas</a> or others are treated with more priority. This is the main reason why you are suggested to file your application for a German tourism/visitor visa as soon as possible.</p><h3>Tourist/Visitor Schengen Visa Validity</h3><p>The longest time you can remain in Germany with a tourist Schengen visa is three months. However, the German embassy in your home country is the one that decides how many days you can spend in Germany, and within which dates. Please understand that there is a slight difference between visa validity and the duration of stay.</p><p>Visa validity is the first date you can enter the Schengen Area, and the last day you must leave. Whereas, duration of stay is the number of days you can spend in the Schengen, within the validity of your visa. Therefore, the validity of a visa has been always longer than the duration of stay. Do not violate the validity of your visa nor the duration of stay; otherwise, you may face a ban or deportation.</p><p>If you still have questions about a visa to Germany, please read the <a href=\"https://www.germany-visa.org/visa-faq/\">Frequently Asked Questions about a Germany Visa</a> and their answers, so you may find what you need.</p><div style=\"font-size: 0px;

There are many vacant jobs in Germany for foreigners. You will not have it hard to find a suitable job for you, especially if you have the professional qualifications.</p><p>The process of getting a job in Germany for foreigners goes as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Look for a job online</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Public German job sites</strong>. The international Placement Service (ZAV) of the German Employment Agency has information on world opportunities all across Germany.

Note that they will charge you a fee for signing up with them.</p><p><strong>Contact companies in Germany</strong>. It is totally okay to write to a German company and ask them if they are planning to take in any new employees, even if they do not have any vacancy announcement.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Apply for the job you have found</strong></li></ol><p>After you find the job that fits you, send a job application.
